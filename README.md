# Datasets
* Houston2013 Dataset: The dataset, which captured scenes over the University of Houston campus and adjacent urban areas, consisted of HSI and LiDAR-based Digital Surface Model(DSM), both with a data size of $349 \times 1905$ pixels and a spatial resolution of 2.5m. The HSI consists of 144 bands with a wavelength range of 0.38 to 1.05$\mu$m. The dataset has a total of 15029 ground-truth samples, covering 15 categories.
* Trento Dataset: The dataset acquired HSI and LiDAR data from a rural area south of Trento, Italy, with a size of $166 \times 600$ pixels and a spatial resolution of 1m. HSI has 63 spectral bands with a wavelength range of 0.42 to 0.99$\mu$m. The dataset contained a total of 30214 truth value samples and studied six distinguishable class labels.
* MUUFL Dataset: The dataset obtained HSI and LiDAR data from the University of Southern Mississippi, Gulfport Campus in Long Beach, Mississippi, USA, with a size of $325 \times 220$ pixels. HSI has 64 available spectral channels ranging from 0.38 to 1.05 $\mu$m with a spatial resolution of $0.54 \times 1.0 m$. LiDAR data is captured by an ALTM sensor using a laser at a wavelength of 1064 nm. The spatial resolution is $0.60 \times 0.78 m$. The dataset contains a total of 53,687 truth samples, and 11 distinguishable class labels are studied.
* Augsburg Data: The dataset captures the RS scenario for the city of Augsburg. The HSI data includes 180 spectral bands in the 400-2500 nm wavelength range. The LiDAR data consists of $332 \times 485$ pixels and depicts seven unique land cover categories.
